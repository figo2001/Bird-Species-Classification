## Introduction

With the advancement of deep learning techniques, building image classifiers has become more accessible than ever. This project demonstrates how to leverage CNNs to create a web application for predicting bird species from images. 

## Features

- Upload bird images to get predictions on their species.
- User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
- Utilizes a CNN model trained on bird image datasets for accurate predictions.

## Demo

Here's a quick demo of the web application in action. Try it out yourself to see how accurate the predictions are!

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/bird-image-classifier.git

## Usage
Once installed, you can start the web application by running:
```bash
python app.py
```

## Model Training
The CNN model used for predicting bird species is trained on a bird image dataset. If you wish to retrain the model or use a different dataset, you can modify the training script (train.py) and replace the dataset accordingly.

To train the model:
```bash
python train.py
```
